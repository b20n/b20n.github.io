title:  "'Modern Garbage Collection'"
date: 2017-01-08

[This is a really nice article][1]. As an overview of modern garbage collection
techniques it's serviceable, but I'm rather more interested in its
meta-arguments about rigor in software engineering. Most interesting problems -
e.g., garbage collection, or databases, or whatever - are really hard problems.
This doesn't mean one shouldn't spend time investigating them, but rather that
one should exercise healthy skepticism about "strictly superior" solutions. And
_always_ ask about the *tradeoffs*.
