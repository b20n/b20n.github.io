title:  "Identifying Elegance"

The idea of "striving for elegance" is an interesting lens through which to view
the activity/craft/science/whatever of programming. Merely putting something
together that "works" is rarely good enough; good programs are elegant, and good
programmers strive to make their programs more elegant.

Unforunately we seem to throw this word "elegance" quite a bit without perhaps
having a concrete shared understanding of what it means. It's often obvious when
something lacks elegance - performing an operation twice "just in case",
duplicated functionality, etc. - but it's harder to see elegance when it's
there. Concepts like cyclomatic complexity are interesting, and related, but
ultimately it's much like [abstraction][1]: for better or worse, it's intuitive.

Accepting this implies two things:

1. As a professional programmer it's your responsibility to continually craft a
   personal and at least somewhat defensible notion of elegance that you can
   apply to your work. You can't assume that your "elegance" is the "True
   Elegance".

2. It's important to respect others' notions of elegance, and try to understand
   them. They might have a viewpoint that you could incorporate in to your own
   work.
