title:  "Various Things Other People Have Said That I Have Enjoyed"

Seymour Papert, "Computer Criticism vs. Technocentric Thinking":

> Observing what a design team finds worth giving up is a window into its
> aesthetics and its intellectual values."

Freeman Dyson, _Disturbing the Universe_:

> The essential factor which keeps scientific enterprise healthy is a shared
> respect for quality.

> Technology has made evil anonymous.

> It is impossible to make real progress in technology without gambling. And the
> trouble with gambling is that you do not always win.

> A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person
> who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible.

Marshall McLuhan, _The Gutenberg Galaxy_:

> It is a consumer-oriented culture that is concerned with authors and labels of
> authenticity. Manuscript culture was producer-oriented, almost entirely a
> do-it-yourself culture, and naturally looked to the relevance and usability of
> items rather than their sources.

> In our electronic age the specialist and pyramidal forms of structure, which
> achieve vogue in the sixteenth century and later, are not any longer
> practical.

Don Delillo, _Libra_:

> At twenty years old, all you know is that you're twenty. Everything else is a
> mist that swirls around this fact.

John Dewey, _Democracy and Education_:

> The life of observation, meditation, cogitation, and speculation pursued as an
> end in itself is the proper life of man.

Alasdair MacIntyre, _After Virtue_:

> For in our culture we know of no organized movement towards power that is not
> bureaucratic and managerial in mode and we know of no justifications for
> authority which are not Weberian in form.

John Dewey, _Human Nature and Conduct_:

> A physician or engineer is free in his thought and in his action in the degree
> in which he knows what he deals with.

Alan Kay:

> You don't want architects and coders, you want architects and optimizers. Once
> you're thinking about optimizing it's impossible to do any design at all.

> Part of why computer science is not a science is because it spends its time
> only building things; it doesn't spend its time trying to understand them.

Hayao Miyazaki, _Starting Point: 1979-1996_:

> Any true professional, if engaged in fulfilling work, will work as hard as he
> or she can. [...] to me, passion and effort are what working is all about.

Miles Davis:

> If you understood everything I said, you'd be me.

Haruki Murakami, _1Q84_:

> It is not that the meaning cannot be explained. But there are certain meanings
> that are lost forever the moment they are explained in words.

John Dewey, _Art As Experience_:

> The artist embodies himself in the attitude of the perceiver while he works.

> An artist, in comparison with his fellows, is one who is not only especially
> gifted in powers of execution but in unusual sensitivity to the qualities of
> things.

Haruki Murakami, _Hear The Wind Sing_:

> A gulf separates what we attempt to perceive from what we are actually able to
> perceive

Ivan Illich, _Deschooling Society_:

> I believe that a desirable future depends on our deliberately choosing a life
> of action over a life of consumption, on our engendering a life style which
> will enable us to be spontaneous, independent, yet related to each other,
> rather than maintaining a life style which only allows us to make and unmake,
> produce and consume.

Jane Jacobs, _The Death And Life of Great American Cities_, on bad diversity in
urban design:

> ...a chaos of shouted, superficial differences

James C. Scott, _Seeing Like A State_:

> Once you have crafted lenses that change your perspective, it is a great
> temptation to look at everything through the same spectacles

Attributed to the Talmud by Alan Kay, but that's probably apocryphal:

> We see things not as they are, but as we are

Thomas Mann, _The Magic Mountain_:

> Time, they say, is water from the river Lethe, but alien air is a similar
> drink; and if its effects are less profound, it works all the more quickly.

> One must apply truth and energy in naming things. It elevates and intensifies
> life.

Butler Lampson (paraphrased):

> A compiler is a way to change coordinate systems

Umberto Eco, _On Literature_:

> Aphorisms [...] aim to go more profoundly into a matter on which current
> opinion seems superficial, and has to be corrected

Gottlob Frege:

> So a great part of the work of a philosopher consists - or at least ought to
> consist - in a struggle against language. But perhaps only a few people are
> aware of the need for this.

[Tadhg Kelly][9]:

> And that’s why Chess and Go remain as enduringly popular as they are, and why
> soccer is the most popular game on earth. Robustness and elegance are the key
> driving forces here, and they are in direct opposition to the brittleness and
> complexity, the defining traits of story.

[Richard Hamming][8]:

> I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within
> their grasp don’t succeed are: they don’t work on important problems, they
> don’t become emotionally involved, they don’t try and change what is difficult
> to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they
> keep giving themselves alibis why they don’t. They keep saying that it is a
> matter of luck.

[Joe Armstrong][7]:

> I remember Mike, Robert and I having great fun asking the same question over
> and over again: “what happens if it fails?” – the answer we got was almost
> always a variant on “our model assumes no failures.” We seemed to be the only
> people in the world designing a system that could recover from software
> failures.

[Bret Victor][6]:

> Interface matters to me more than anything else, and it always has. I just
> never realized that. I’ve spent a lot of time over the years desperately
> trying to think of a “thing” to change the world. I now know why the search
> was fruitless – things don’t change the world. People change the world by
> using things. The focus must be on the “using”, not the “thing”. Now that I’m
> looking through the right end of the binoculars, I can see a lot more clearly,
> and there are projects and possibilities that genuinely interest me deeply.

[Howard Rheingold][5]:

> If you want to maintain independence in the era of large institutions and
> think fresh thoughts in the age of mass media, you are going to need good
> tools.

Christopher Alexander, _The Timeless Way of Building_:

> An organism could only exist without stress in an environment in which there
> were no conflicts or challenges at all - and under such circumstances the
> organism would atrophy and die.

[Alan Kay][3]:

> Small minds try to form religions, the great ones just want better routes up
> the mountain.

[Patrick Collison][2]:

> Though this certainly doesn’t always happen, I think it’s easy for product
> management structures to make programming less fun. Most people fall in love
> with programming because of the ease with which you can jump from an idea to a
> tangible, working reification. If that path takes a detour through a product
> management organization, a lot of the joy can dissolve. I’m always worried
> about trading off enjoyment for ostensible efficiency. Even if it is more
> efficient, if someone ends up spending 30% less time hacking on a project
> because it’s just less enjoyable, you’ve probably still lost.

Alexander Berkman, on egalitarianism:

> [...] equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity… Do not
> make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality
> of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It
> does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the
> same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact…
> Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal
> opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from
> leveling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of
> activity and development. For human character is diverse."
